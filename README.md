# vCard QR Code Creator Inkscape extension

Inspired by [Sergey Vedernikov's vCard QR Code generator extension](https://inkscape.org/~sergey15th13/%E2%98%85vcard-qr-code-generator).

Creates QR codes that contain your personal business card information in a standardized machine readable format, so you can quickly share your info by just letting another person scan your QR code with their mobile phone, e.g. when meeting people at a conference or business fair.

Contains fields for private and business information.

All fields are optional, create multiple codes for private and business events.
